Tile-server is a web application suitable for helping with tile based mapping.

This first implementation uses the cube project to source the data from tiles, which resides in HBase.  Currently
the cube holds content in Avro format, and this project is therefore concerned with delivering that to the browser.
Currently there is a DensityTile renderer, which produces PNGs, and an experimental servlet which produces GeoJSON.
Only the density tile servlet is wired up in Guice and suitable for use at this stage.

To run this project, simply run 
  mvn jetty:run
  
Please be aware that this has hard coded config, and an open Jira exists to correct this:
  http://dev.gbif.org/issues/browse/POR-256
  

FOR DEVELOPERS:
To assist in development, there is an implementation of a memory backed cube which can be activated in the application.properties.
Please see the example in /conf which has detailed comments.  The memory backed cube expects a GZipped CSV file containing latitude, 
longitude and numRecords, which is then read into memory and assembled into the cube.  This is not meant for production use, but only
to assist those developing rendering services.
